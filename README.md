# Home-Price-Prediction
The Home Price Prediction project uses a machine learning model to estimate house prices based on location, size, number of bathrooms, and total area. The model is deployed on a Flask server, and a React UI collects user inputs, sends them to the server, receives the predicted price, and displays the result.
